    To share a GitHub repository, first note its name and go to its page on GitHub. Then, click the <b>Fork</b> button in the upper
    right corner to make a copy on your own account. Be sure to select <b>"Copy Main Only"</b> in the confirmation windows to avoid
    affecting the original repository and its other branches with changes or updates.</p>

    It is recommended for the user to create a new branch under the <b>Develop</b> branch of the MoilApp repository after cloning, in order to prevent conflicts between their changes and updates made to the original repository. This is crucial, as it enables the user to work on their modifications separately, without impacting the primary codebase.</p>
